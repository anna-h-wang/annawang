## About Me

I am currently a PhD student at McGill University under the supervision of Dr. Daniele Malomo. My research covers masonry structures, earthquake engineering, and structural assessment & retrofit. I also research engineering education, focusing on implementing design-build-test projects and makerspace learning.

I recently completed my M.S. in Structural Engineering from UC San Diego with an emphasis in Structural Analysis and Advanced Composites. I also hold a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Georgia Tech. 

My industry background spans multiple disciplines including construction litigation, structural engineering/mechanics, and mechanical testing of composites/polymers. Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as an Associate Project Consultant at SGHâ€™s Engineering, Mechanics, & Infrastructure division, where I obtained my EIT license. 

If you are a student interested in pursuing anything from my background or if you just want some advice about navigating your college career, I am more than willing to chat with you! I would not be where I am today without my mentors, and I am happy to pay it forward. Please don't hesitate to connect with me on LinkedIn or email me at anna.wang4@mail.mcgill.ca
